At that point, even though we had no clarity on when we planned on taking this next step, the one thing I was very sure of, was where the celebration would happen. Iâ€™ve always loved Gallops, not only for how beautiful it is and because the food is impeccable, but also because @chefyajushmalik is the nicest human, and always makes us feel like weâ€™re home.
